    # Fail if coverage is below threshold
    # Note: 50% threshold accounts for app.py and handlers/* (UI glue code)
    # which are difficult to unit test
    # Core business logic (models, validation, state, components) has 93-100% coverage

# Markers for test categorization
markers =
    unit: Unit tests (fast, isolated)
    integration: Integration tests (may require external resources)
    slow: Slow tests (may take several seconds)
    requires_model: Tests requiring model downloads (skip in CI)

# Coverage configuration moved to .coveragerc for better pytest-cov integration
