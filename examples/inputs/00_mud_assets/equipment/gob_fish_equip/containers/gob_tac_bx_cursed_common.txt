a battered wooden tackle box with warped hinges and fish stains
a dented tin tackle box rattling with loose hooks
a cracked leather satchel stuffed with tangled fishing gear
a driftwood crate bound with rope and rusted nails
a simple canvas tackle roll tied with twine
a salvaged lunch tin repurposed as a tackle container
a wooden drawer box missing its original handle
a wicker basket lined with oily rags and scales
