a reinforced wooden tackle box patched with scrap metal plates
a brass-latched tackle case engraved with crude goblin symbols
a segmented tackle box with unevenly sized compartments
a tackle box with a hidden false bottom
a waterproof resin-sealed tackle case that smells strongly of chum
a tackle container fitted with a crude locking mechanism
a tackle box wrapped in charms, teeth, and fishing trophies
a bone-reinforced tackle case clattering softly when moved
