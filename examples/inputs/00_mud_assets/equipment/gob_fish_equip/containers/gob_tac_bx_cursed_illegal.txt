a living tackle box that flexes slightly when handled
a container that snaps open under moonlight
a tackle box containing a bound elemental spark
a box that teleports small items between compartments
a tackle container that attracts creatures when opened
a tackle box labelled “NOT A BOX”
a container that seals itself if tampered with incorrectly
a tackle box that screams briefly when shut
