a cursed tackle box that snaps shut without warning
a container that whispers advice when opened
a tackle box that leaks water no matter where it is stored
a box that occasionally produces items never placed inside
a tackle container sealed with chains and scratched warnings
a box that slowly rusts everything placed within it
a tackle box that rattles even when empty
a container that cannot be fully emptied
