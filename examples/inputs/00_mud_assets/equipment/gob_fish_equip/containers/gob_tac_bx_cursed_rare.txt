a rune-scratched tackle box that vibrates faintly near water
a crystal-windowed tackle case glowing softly from within
a tackle container that always feels slightly warm
a box of interlocking plates that reassemble themselves incorrectly
a charm-bound tackle box sealed with wax and warning marks
a tackle container that hums when opened
a lacquered box that reflects distorted images of its contents
a tackle box that rearranges its contents overnight
