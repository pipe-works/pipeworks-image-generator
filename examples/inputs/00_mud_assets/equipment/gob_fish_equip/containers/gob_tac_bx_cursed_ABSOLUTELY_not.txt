a tackle box that cannot be opened twice the same way
a container that replaces lost items with worse ones
a box that grows heavier the longer it remains closed
a tackle container emitting faint heat and ticking sounds
a box that smells of fish, ozone, and regret
a container officially listed as destroyed
a tackle box with an interior larger than its exterior
a container that insists it is empty
