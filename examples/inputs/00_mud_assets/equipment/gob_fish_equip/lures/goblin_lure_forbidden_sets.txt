a lure that emits hypnotic light patterns underwater
a lure containing a trapped minor spirit
a lure that mimics distress calls unnervingly well
a lure soaked in forbidden alchemical attractants
a lure that subtly warps nearby currents
a lure that pulses in time with nearby movement
a lure that glows brighter the closer prey gets
a lure sealed with warning wax and sigils
