a carved bone lure shaped like a small struggling fish
a glowing fungus lure sealed in resin
a spinner lure fitted with clicking beads
a floating lure that slowly sinks when wet
a multi-jointed wooden lure with erratic movement
a lure wrapped in preserved bait-scent cloth
a polished shell lure that reflects light sharply
a lure with dangling metal teeth for vibration
