a strip of shiny tin tied to line as a flashing lure
a dangling bundle of feathers and fish scales
a carved wooden lure painted with crude eyes
a lump of scented bait wrapped in cloth
a cork-and-bone float lure that wobbles erratically
a scrap-metal spinner that rattles underwater
a slug-shaped clay lure soaked in fish oil
a knotted rope lure with dangling threads
