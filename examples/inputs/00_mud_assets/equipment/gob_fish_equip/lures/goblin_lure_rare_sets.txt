a faintly glowing lure that pulses like a heartbeat
a lure containing trapped bioluminescent insects
a mirrored lure that reflects distorted images
a lure that emits low clicking sounds underwater
a charm-bound lure said to “call” fish
a lure carved from crystal with refractive facets
a lure that leaves a shimmering trail
a lure etched with warning runes scratched over older runes
