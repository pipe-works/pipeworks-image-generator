a bent iron fishing hook hammered flat and reshaped by hand
a crude bone hook carved from fish spine and tied with twine
a rusted hook salvaged from ship debris and filed sharp
a thick wire hook twisted unevenly into shape
a small triple-hook cluster bound together with resin
a stone-weighted hook designed to sink fast in murky water
a hook carved from shell with a jagged cutting edge
a mismatched hook-and-barb assembly wired together poorly
