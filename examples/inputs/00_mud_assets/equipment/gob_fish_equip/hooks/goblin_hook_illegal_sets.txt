a living-metal hook that reshapes itself mid-catch
a hook that violently retracts on its own
a hook that anchors prey to the riverbed
a hook that occasionally reels in nothing at all
a hook containing a bound elemental shard
a hook that sparks when under tension
a hook labelled “DO NOT CAST”
a hook that reels faster than the line allows
