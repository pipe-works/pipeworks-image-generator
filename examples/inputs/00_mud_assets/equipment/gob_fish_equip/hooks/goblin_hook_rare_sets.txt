a rune-etched hook that tightens when prey struggles
a crystal-tipped hook that vibrates underwater
a living bone hook that slowly re-curves itself
a hook bound with charm tokens and teeth
a barbed hook that resists corrosion unnaturally
a hook that subtly pulls toward movement
a multi-pronged hook designed for massive prey
a hook that locks once embedded
