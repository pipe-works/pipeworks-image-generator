a hook forged from unknown black metal that never dulls
a cursed hook that reels prey even when slack
a hook that grows additional barbs once embedded
a hook that anchors itself unnaturally
a hook bound to a whispering charm
a hook that slowly drains vitality from its catch
a hook etched with sigils of binding
a hook that resists removal once set
