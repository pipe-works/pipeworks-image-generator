a stack of driftwood planks used as makeshift cutting boards
a tangle of enchanted lures that glow, twitch, or whisper faintly
a goblin-sized spear gun assembled from pipes, springs, and unknown liquids
a woven basket full of freshwater clams and stolen shiny objects
a slippery pile of scales and fish bones left from last night’s “experiment”
a mud-caked pair of goblin waders patched with tar and fungus wax
