a mud-skimmer fish with flat fins and cloudy eyes
a silver flickerfish that darts in tight schools
a thick-scaled river carp with chipped teeth
a whiskered bottom-feeder that smells worse than it tastes
a pale cave fish with translucent skin
a slow-moving algae grazer coated in green slime
a spotted marsh trout with unusually tough scales
a pebble-colored river loach that hides in silt
