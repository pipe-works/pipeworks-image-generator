a fish that continues biting after being removed from water
a fish that slowly gnaws through fishing lines
a fish with too many eyes that watches silently
a fish that leaks black water when injured
a fish that rearranges itself when not observed
a fish that vanishes when killed
a fish that weighs far more than its size suggests
a fish that should not exist in fresh water
