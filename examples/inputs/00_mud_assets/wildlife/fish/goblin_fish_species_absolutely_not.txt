a fish that mimics voices from the shore
a fish that causes hooks to rust instantly
a fish that bites *back up the line*
a fish that hums loudly when submerged
a fish that attracts larger, unseen things
a fish officially banned from goblin cookpots
a fish that insists it is not a fish
a fish the river tries to reclaim immediately
