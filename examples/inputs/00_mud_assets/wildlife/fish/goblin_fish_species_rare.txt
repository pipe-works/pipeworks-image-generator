a barbed-fin fish that thrashes violently when hooked
a river lurker with camouflage scales and sudden strikes
a blood-scented fish that follows wounded prey
a hooked-jaw fish that locks onto lines stubbornly
a fast-spinning fish that tangles nets intentionally
a river brute with scarred scales and missing fins
a fish that emits a painful electric jolt when touched
a venom-spined fish avoided by experienced goblins
