a talking river fish that loudly complains when caught
a smug silver fish that claims it was “expecting this”
a whispering fish that bargains for release
a fish that speaks only in lies
a fish that knows personal secrets it should not
a prophetic fish that gives terrible advice
a fish that screams insults in fluent Goblin
a fish that demands tribute before being eaten
