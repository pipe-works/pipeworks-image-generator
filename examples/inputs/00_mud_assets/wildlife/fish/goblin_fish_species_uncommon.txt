a hook-snapping fish with powerful jaw muscles
a spiny-backed river fish that flares when threatened
a darting needlefish with razor fins
a snapping eel-fish that coils aggressively
a thick-bodied fish that inflates when caught
a river predator with rows of blunt crushing teeth
a leaping fish that attempts escape violently
a territorial stream fish that attacks shiny objects
